        <p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">For Antonio   Torres</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">, &ldquo;Senhorita Carioca has not only the   merit</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">s of being well-researched, but also has a light   touch to the text, starting with the title itself, but also is easy to read, and   thus brings the average reader that bit closer to the history of Rio de Janeiro&rdquo;   and concluded that &ldquo;for such a reader, this is a book that will certainly   contribute to raising interest for other books that have been or will be   written.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">By   coincidence, at the same period as Antonio Torres was doing   research for &ldquo;O   Nobre Seq&uuml;estrador&rdquo; (The Noble Kidnapper), a novel about the   French Corsair Duguay-Trouin, who, during the reign of Louis XIV robbed and   killed in the name of the King, an early version of &ldquo;Senhorita Carioca&rdquo; was   covering one of the most curious and violent episodes of the City&rsquo;s history, the   holding to ransom of Rio de Janeiro. The captor:   Duguay-Trouin.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">It was this   common interest in the same story and the history of Rio that brought the two writers   together.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">While   sitting in a caf&eacute; in the Ipanema district of Rio Antonio Torres,   Raquel Boechat   and Tomil Gon&ccedil;alves got talking about their projects about the   city during the first centuries of colonization, sketched the most likely routes   taken by Trouin in his trek around the hills of Rio and spent several   entertaining hours in an imaginary voyage behind the scenes of   history.</span></p>

        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">One of the   most successful Brazilian authors, journalist and advertising   professionals.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">His first   book was published in 1972 and he now has 13 novels in print, with translations   in Cuba, Argentina, France, Germany, Italy, Britain the USA, Israel and the   Netherlands.</span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">A   prize-winning writer in several countries, <U>Antonio Torres</U>&nbsp; was made a   member by the French Government of the prestigious order of merit&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres&rdquo;</em>, in   1988, for his novels The Land&nbsp; &ldquo;Essa Terra&rdquo; and &ldquo;Um T&aacute;xi para Viena d&rsquo;&Aacute;ustria&rdquo;   (A Taxi to Vienna, Austria). He received the Machado de Assis prize from the   Brazilian Academy of Letters for his life&rsquo;s work and won the Passo Fundo Zaffari   &amp; Bourbon prize for literature in 2001 for &ldquo;My Dear   Cannibal&rdquo;.</span></p></td>

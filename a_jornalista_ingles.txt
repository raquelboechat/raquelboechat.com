campo=<HTML><BODY>RAQUEL BOECHAT has made a conscious choice to stay behind the cameras and to keep her face from the TV screen, preferring instead to give emphasis to the emotions contained in statements and eye witness accounts and the message in the pauses and electing to give priority to the strength of the images themselves.

Of course, her daily job has opened doors to multidisciplinary knowledge that is a natural consequence of experiences shared with workmates, film directors, producers, technicians, interviewees and clients. She has thus learned different ways of consi-dering things and new ways of working with ideas, of viewing humanity,  society and communication, stories and television, of doing interviews and questions, deter-mining the ideal focus, organizing  research and finding the ideal spin for a concept.

In her curriculum vitae there are one presidential <A HREF="mark_politico_ingles.html"><U>campaign</U></A>, dozens of state gubernatorial, Senate and Federal Con-gress elections, hundreds of news and entertainment programmes for TV; live broadcasts; educational and <a href="comunicacao_estrategica_ingles.html"><U>institutional videos</U></A>; speeches and comments for <A HREF="tv.html_ingles"><U>TV</U></A>, plus seminars, events and conventions. Her career has been as varied as the events, <A HREF="midias_ingles.html"><U>media</U></A>, public and requirements that have filled her work schedule during all these years.

Creating partnerships, setting up her own <A HREF="projetos_ingles.html"><U>projects</U></A> and working with agencies, pro-ducers, organizations, NGOs, TV sta-tions in Brazil and abroad, RAQUEL BOECHAT provides consultancy and assistance; she creates develops, coordinates directs and writes material; she makes an active contribution to positive image building, is an expert in crisis administration, and can help to improve on the positive results of public and private administrations, win over opinions, audiences and electorates, lea-ding to greater electoral successes, none of which  would be possible without the assistance and input of ordinary people, public personalities, broadcasters, organi-zations, politicians and members of governments.

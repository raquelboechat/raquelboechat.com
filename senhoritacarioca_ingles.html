      <td width="280"><p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">A previously unpublished work,   including in Brazil, on the   history and influences of Rio de Janeiro, a major   cradle of culture, a living link between Europe, Africa and Asia. </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&ldquo;Senhorita Carioca&rdquo; - the book -   will recount the history of this tropical city, which has become one of the   loveliest and most famous cities in the world.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Star</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">ting with the official   version of history, or that of the &ldquo;little guys&rdquo; that official history prefers   to ignore, but was nevertheless witnessed,&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Senhorita Carioca&quot; shows the   reader and makes him live through the day-to-day life and the formation of the   Brazilian people and the soul of Rio de   Janeiro via the construction of the city itself.&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Important characters in both   history and science, such as Americo Vespucci, Columbus, Napoleon, Humboldt,   Cook, von Martius and von Spix, to name but a few, had some connection to the   City. Marks, whether these be physical, political, economic or cultural, and   which have helped to make Rio   de Janeiro what it is today. Examples include when the city had   an epidemic of fever, the day to day life in the biggest communal lodging-house   of the 19th century, the details of the negotiation which nearly led   to Sugar Loaf being raised to the ground, and an exotic touch, with exclusive   recipes for snakes, alligators and other animals, which have not been part of   the Brazilian diet&nbsp; for more than a century, taken from ancient   cookbooks.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The smells and sounds of the   dawning day are also in &quot;Senhorita Carioca&quot;, which has a light touch in the way   it recounts its tale. The reader navigates his way through the text, with boxes   for additional information, maps from different times and pictorial content, a   lot of which has not been seen before, even in a city which has been one of the   most depicted in the world during the past two hundred   years.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">One can see the construction and   evolution of the city space and means of transport, the importance of bathing   and how water determines how the city can be utilized; beaches, bikinis,   religion, music, <em>capoeira,</em> carnival, football, <em>feijoada,</em> immigrants, architecture, habits and customs which make up one of the most   varied landscapes in different times, described from eyewitnesses in letters,   diaries, cartoons, news stories or advertising.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The more than 200 illustrations,   selected with great care, are signed by artists of many nationalities, styles,   techniques and time periods, and come from private collections or the most   important archives in Brazil   and Europe.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">In order to give the reader a   better understanding of the history of what is one of the best-loved cities in   the world, to be able to go behind the scenes in the early days of samba, to   understand the love for football, the beach and the suntan, &ldquo;Senhorita Carioca&rdquo;   invites the reader to get to know the city of Rio de Janeiro through its   intimate history, to follow paths in a place that started out as a minor port   and became the Capital of the Portuguese Empire, then Capital of the Court, then   of the Empire and of the Republic.&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">To the eyes of the stranger, voyage   through time and space, shedding light on a presence, which is still alive today   in the essence of the culture of Rio de Janeiro, showing us what it means to be   Brazilian.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The reader grows along with the   city as he follows its trajectory, and has fun watching Rio overcoming its   difficulties and abuses, &ldquo;Senhorita Carioca&rdquo; tells of a living city, during the   five centuries covered, courteously available, courageously feminine, open to a <em>joie de vivre</em> and to the future.   One can feel the link between the not-do-distant past - perhaps lost - of the   Old world, the direction that the Brazilian spirit gives to the New World, re-establishing communication with all those   who recognise a little part of themselves in the story.<strong><U></U></strong></span></p></td>

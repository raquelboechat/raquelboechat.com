campo=<HTML><BODY>Among ongoing projects for the publishing, TV and Internet markets, with partners in Brazil, Bolivia, Germany and the Netherlands, is the book <a href="javascript:window.open('senhoritacarioca_ingles.html','carioca','width=700, height=450');void(0);"><U>“Senhorita Carioca”</U></a>.

Produced in partnership with researcher and TV director <a href="javascript:window.open('tomil_ingles.html','tomil','width=650, height=450');void(0);"><U>Tomil Gonçalves</U></a>, the book takes the form of a journalistic piece on four centuries of the history of Rio de Janeiro.

Along with the text, which uses light language, but which is dense in content, are more than 200 pictures, many previously unpublished, even in Brazil, gleaned from collectors, libraries and museums in both Brazil and Europe.

The book was designed in order to teach the reader a little about this, one of the most important cradles of Brazilian culture and the essence of what it means to be Brazilian, to increase the respect given to the particularities of Rio de Janeiro and to enhance the reader’s wish to explore the “ Marvellous City”. The book makes the reader really feel that he was born a native of Rio, and therefore a traditional figure in Brazilian culture, and aims to awaken a critical consciousness of how a city, a state or a country is built and, who knows, after reading “Senhorita Carioca”, leaves the reader able to see Rio and the Brazilian people as a whole, with new eyes.

With this book, it becomes apparent that problems which seemed to have been rooted in the distant past or blamed on spectacular growth or to misadministration by past and present-day politicians can be seen to be simply aspects of human nature which do not change significantly over the centuries.

The publication of “Senhorita Carioca” is scheduled for 2007 and has the institutional backing of writer <a href="javascript:window.open('antonio_torres_ingles.html','torres','width=700, height=450, scrollbars=yes');void(0);"><U>Antonio Torres</U></a>, economist, professor and former Rector of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), <a href="javascript:window.open('carlos_lessa_ingles.html','lessa','width=700, height=450, scrollbars=yes');void(0);"><U>Carlos Lessa</U></a>, and of <a href="javascript:window.open('intituto_ibero_americano_ingles.html','ibero','width=700, height=450, scrollbars=yes');void(0);"><U>The Ibero-American Institute Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation</U></a> in Berlin, Germany.
